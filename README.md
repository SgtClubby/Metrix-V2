# Metrix V2

## How can I add Metrix V2 to my server?

First and foremost, Metrix is private. Additionally, Metrix does not support self-hosting without alot of additional setup, so running a copy yourself is not advised.

## About this repository

The code here is strictly and routinely updated. Running this code on your own is not supported; I will not be providing the resources necessary to self-host.
